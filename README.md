# Cloud computing notes

## Cloud computing

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis.

In short, its like renting server or other computing service.

### How do we know if something is in the Cloud? (on-prem vs the cloud)

- ***On premisis***: Physical infrastructure that is owned and operated by an organization in its own data centers.
- ***The cloud***: Services and resources hosted by a third-party provider and accessed over the internet.

Easiest way to know if it's in the cloud is that you can access it anywhere with an internet connection. Turn off your internet and see if it still works.

### What are some popular cloud computing services and how are they used?

- ***Dropbox***: Cloud storage
- ***AWS***: Commonly used for hosting websites, data storage, and running applications
- ***Microsoft Azure***: Hosting applications, providing storage, enabling networking, and offering analytics and AI capabilities
- ***GCP (google cloud platform)***: Commonly used for data analysis and AI services

### Explain the four main cloud deployment models

- ***Public Cloud***: The cloud infrastructure is owned and operated by a third-party provider and shared with other organizations. (AWS, Azure)
- ***Private Cloud***: The cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by one organization. It can be hosted either on-premises or by a third-party provider.
- ***Hybrid Cloud***: A combination of both public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
- ***Community Cloud***: Shared infrastructure that is used by a specific community of organizations with common concerns
  
### Explain the three main types of cloud service

- ***Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)***: Delivers on-demand infrastructure resources, such as compute, storage, networking, and virtualization. With IaaS, the service provider owns and operates the infrastructure, but customers will need to purchase and manage software, such as operating systems, middleware, data, and applications.
- ***Platform as a Service (PaaS)***: Delivers and manages hardware and software resources for developing, testing, delivering, and managing cloud applications. Providers typically offer middleware, development tools, and cloud databases
- ***Software as a Service (SaaS)***: Provides a full application stack as a service that customers can access and use. SaaS solutions often come as ready-to-use applications, which are managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.

### What are some of the main advantages of the cloud?

- ***Cost Savings***: Cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront investment in hardware and reduces maintenance costs.
- ***Scalability***: Resources can be scaled up or down according to demand, making it highly flexible.
- ***Accessibility***: Cloud services can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.
- ***Automatic Updates***: Cloud service providers handle maintenance and updates, reducing the burden on IT teams.
- ***Disaster Recovery***: Cloud providers often have built-in disaster recovery solutions and backup capabilities.
- ***Collaboration***: Cloud platforms often have tools that enhance collaboration, such as file sharing and real-time updates.

### What are some potential pitfalls/disadvantages of using the cloud?

- ***Security Risks***: Data stored in the cloud may be vulnerable to breaches or unauthorized access, depending on the providerâ€™s security measures.
- ***Downtime***: Cloud services can experience outages, which may disrupt access to critical services.
- ***Vendor Lock-in***: Migrating from one cloud provider to another can be challenging and costly due to differences in service models and data formats.
- ***Compliance Issues***: Organizations in regulated industries may face challenges in ensuring their cloud provider meets necessary compliance standards.
- ***Data Transfer Costs***: Moving large amounts of data into and out of the cloud can incur significant charges.

### Which Cloud Provider is best? What are the big three known for?

- ***AWS*** is the largest and most comprehensive cloud provider, excelling in flexibility, scalability, and a wide array of services.
- ***Azure*** is known for its strong integration with Microsoft services and hybrid cloud offerings.
- ***GCP*** is known for its strengths in data analytics, AI, and Kubernetes/container orchestration.
